### Takeaway comments ###
- [x] Successfully deploy the code on cloudflare pages.
- building apps from scratch takes more time than i anticipated, but the main objective was done. but the design is still bad. (previously i prepared some templates/boilerplate for the project. but later on, i realized on the test notes that the project must be build from scratch, so it takes me more time)
